We investigate over-crowding in the Emergency Room of the University of Michigan Hospital.
The data, $x_t$, are hourly occupancy fractions for one year, starting July 1st 2005. Occupancy fraction is defined to be the mean number of patients in the ER during each hour  divided by the total number of beds available (the ER operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year).
Note that the occupancy fraction, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:er}, can exceed one.
The purposes of investigating these data are to predict future occupancy, and to make progress toward relating ER overcrowding with other variables such as errors in medical procedures.

A1. [1 point] What are the units of frequency in Fig.~\ref{fig:summary}A? 
Explain your reasoning.

A2. [2 points] Explain how you can tell that the periodogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:summary}A has been truncated to exclude high frequencies (this is done to highlight the information about lower frequencies).

%A3. [2 points] Explain why Fig.~\ref{fig:summary} shows that the weekly pattern is (at most) a minor effect.

A3. [3 points] Using Fig.~\ref{fig:summary}, can you reject a null hypothesis that there is no weekly pattern to occupancy fraction? Explain.

{\bf SECTION B}. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:er} suggests that the occupancy could be modeled by a random process whose expected value $\mu_t$ is slowly varying with time.
%B1. [2 points] Could this variation be an annual cycle? Explain.
%\qskip
The variation around the mean in  Fig.~\ref{fig:er} appears quite stable.
 Thus, it may be reasonable to suppose that $x_t-\mu_t$ is stationary, where $\mu_t=E[x_t]$.
We can estimate $\mu_t$ %by an estimate $\hat \mu_t$ found 
using local regression. This is done here using the R command \texttt{mu.hat=loess(x}$ \sim$ \texttt{time,span=0.5)\$fitted}. The estimate $\hat \mu_t$ of $\mu_t$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:smo}.

\end{figure}

B1. [2 points] Briefly describe what ``local regression estimate'' means.

\qskip

\newpage

B2. [2 points] The dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:smo} show an approximate 95\% confidence interval, constructed by adding $\pm 2SE$ where $SE$ is the standard error on the estimate of the mean, as calculated by the local regression. Is this interval appropriate? Explain. You should be able to comment even without a detailed understanding of local regression.

\qskip

B3. [2 points] Could the data be consistent with a model where the mean is not varying with time, e.g. a stationary process? Say yes or no, and explain.

\qskip

%B4. Does the removed trend function contain weekly or daily effects at noticeable levels? One way to look at this is to calculate the periodogram of $\hat\mu_t$.

{\bf SECTION C}. We investigate the stationarity of the detrended occupancy fraction $y_t=x_t-\hat\mu_t$. In particular, we compare the two time intervals  August/September 2005 and March/April 2006.
First, we fit an $ARIMA(1,0,1){\times}(1,0,1)_{24}$ model to the 61 days in August and September 2005. Below is the R output.

C4. [2 points] A comparison of various models is presented in Table~\ref{tab:aic}. What do you conclude from the AIC values in Table~\ref{tab:aic}, together with the previous value of -3124.96 for $ARIMA(1,0,1){\times}(1,0,1)_{24}$?
